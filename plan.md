I want to mkae a plugin for the LEDMatrix project that is a customizable (via the web ui) vegas-scrolling sports scoreboard. I want the user to be able to choose what leagues they would like to include. These leagues would include: NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, NCAA Men's Basketball, and NCAA Men's football. For NCAA sports, the user can choose what conferences of teams to include, specific teams they would like to include, or whether they would like to only look at the top 25 ranked teams. The rest would be excluded. For upcoming games, it would show logos of the teams playing, what time the game is at and the betting spread of the game. For games that already occured, it would show the team logos and the final score of the game. For games currently taking place, it would show the team logos and the current score. Also, I want the logo of the league we are looking at to show before these sections. So, for instance, it would show the NFL logo, and then scroll from right to left with the upcoming games through the current games through the already occured games. Then, it would show the NBA logo, and then scroll from right to left with the upcoming games through the current games through the already occured games, etc... If there are no games on that particular date for the league, it would not show anything. I only want to see games for the current date. I want the user to be able to specify what leagues they want to include/exclude, in case someone isn't interested in a particular sport like the MLB. I want to be able to adjust the scrolling speed and difference layout positions, like how far certain elements are spaced out. Effectively, I want to combine elements of some code that has already been written in certain repositories:

This repo has stuff for NBA/NCAA basketball:
https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/ledmatrix-basketball-scoreboard

This repo has stuff for NFL/NCAA football:
https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/ledmatrix-football-scoreboard

This repo has stuff for soccer:
https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/ledmatrix-soccer-scoreboard

This repo has stuff for baseball:
https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/ledmatrix-baseball-scoreboard

This repo has stuff for hockey:
https://github.com/ChuckBuilds/ledmatrix-hockey-scoreboard

I want the font size, color, and font to be user configurable.
